Game Data Compiler Collection (GDCC)

A collection of programs for compiling/processing source code for use by video
games. This includes compiling to bytecode as well as preprocessing definition
data. The programs are meant to be suitable for use in automated build systems.


GDCC ACS Compiler (gdcc-acc)

Compiles Hexen ACS source into IR data.


GDCC Wad Archiver (gdcc-ar-wad)

Packs and unpacks Doom WAD format archives.


GDCC Assembler (gdcc-as)

Compiles GDCC assembly into IR data for a low-level interface to the IR.


GDCC C Compiler (gdcc-cc)

Compiles C source into IR data.


GDCC C Preprocessor (gdcc-cpp)

Applies C preprocessing to input files.


GDCC IR Dump (gdcc-irdump)

IR inspection and disassembler. Primarily intended for debugging compilers.


GDCC Linker (gdcc-ld)

Linker program for converting intermediary representation files to bytecode.


GDCC MageDefs (gdcc-magedefs)

Processes plain text files into MageCraft NTS format by tokenizing.


GDCC MakeLib (gdcc-makelib)

Compiles entire libraries into IR data.

Usage Overview
===============================================================================

===========================================================
Headers
===========================================================

By default, system headers are looked for under <system path>/lib, which must
have the contents of the repository lib directory. <system path> under Windows
is the executable directory, otherwise /usr/share/gdcc.

If the lib directory is elsewhere, the --lib-path option must be used to locate
it.

Compilation
===============================================================================

===========================================================
Dependencies
===========================================================

Currently, the only library dependency is GMP, the GNU Multiple Precision
Arithmetic Library (https://gmplib.org/) and its C++ API.

Additionally, cmake (https://cmake.org/) is required to build.

===========================================================
Linux
===========================================================

From the repository root, compilation can be done with the following commands:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
Executables and needed shared objects will be generated under their associated
directories under build/src. (For example, gdcc-cc is under build/src/CC.)
