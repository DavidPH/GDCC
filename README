Game Data Compiler Collection (GDCC)

A collection of programs for compiling/processing source code for use by video
games. This includes compiling to bytecode as well as preprocessing definition
data. The programs are meant to be suitable for use in automated build systems.


GDCC ACS Compiler (gdcc-acc)

Compiles Hexen ACS source into IR data.


GDCC Assembler (gdcc-as)

Compiles GDCC assembly into IR data for a low-level interface to the IR.


GDCC C Compiler (gdcc-cc)

Compiles C source into IR data.


GDCC C Preprocessor (gdcc-cpp)

Applies C preprocessing to input files.


GDCC IR Dump (gdcc-irdump)

IR inspection and disassembler. Primarily intended for debugging compilers.


GDCC Linker (gdcc-ld)

Linker program for converting intermediary representation files to bytecode.


GDCC MageDefs (gdcc-magedefs)

Processes plain text files into MageCraft NTS format by tokenizing.
